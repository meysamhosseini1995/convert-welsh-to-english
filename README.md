In one of the projects, I needed to convert a lot of information that was in Welsh characters to English characters. After searching the internet and not finding a solution. I started to develop a code to meet my needs and by changing it and simplifying the code to make it easier to understand, I put it on GitHub so that others can use it.

## Tech

Welsh Convertor uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [PHP] - Hypertext Preprocessor!

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Welsh Convertor requires [PHP](https://www.php.net/) v7.1+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd path/to/your/app

```
And Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in the Browser, You see something like this
